A Web app for doing argument mapping. Built for Truman State University's Spring 2013 Software Engineering course.

Tools we use whose documentation you may find helpful (listed in order of helpfulness):

- [The Slate theme for Boostrap](http://bootswatch.com/slate/), used for rapidly prototyping UI designs. It gives sensible defaults for the most common UI elements in Web apps.
- [The jQuery User Interface library](http://jqueryui.com/), which provides mature, incredibly powerful UI extensions to normal jQuery objects.
- [jQuery, the write-less, do-more Javascript framework](http://jquery.com/). jQuery is Javascript++.
- [Angular.JS](http://angularjs.org/), an MVC/MVP framework for Javascript.
- Some to-be-determined NoSQL database.
